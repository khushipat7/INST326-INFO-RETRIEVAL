Project Overview

The Information Retrieval and Analysis Tool is a Python-based system designed to automatically organize and classify movie-related documents through keyword extraction and content analysis.
This project simplifies the task of managing large movie datasets—such as reviews, scripts, and descriptions—by automatically identifying relevant information and organizing it efficiently.

Key Focus:

Organize and classify Robert Downey Jr. (RDJ) movies by keywords, actor, and genre

Automatically detect shared themes and similarities between movie documents

Enable quick search and retrieval of information using keyword-based indexing

Current Stage — Project 1: Function Library

This stage focuses on foundational programming skills using functions and procedural programming before introducing classes and objects.

Objectives:

Build a library of 15 utility functions to support movie document organization and analysis

Demonstrate clean, reusable, and modular Python design following PEP 8 standards

Prepare the foundation for an object-oriented version in Project 2

Skills Used (Weeks 1–5 Scope):

Variables, expressions, and conditionals

Loops and lists

Function definitions, parameters, and return values

Basic file-free data management (no file I/O yet)

Encapsulation concepts introduced but not applied yet
