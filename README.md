Project Overview

Information Retrieval and Analysis Tool

The Information Retrieval and Analysis Tool is a Python-based project developed to organize and classify movie-related documents through keyword extraction and content analysis. It focuses on automating the process of identifying key information within documents, such as actors, genres, and franchises, and categorizing them efficiently. This project serves as the foundation for building an intelligent movie data management system.

The domain of this project focuses on movie data organization. The problem being addressed is the challenge of manually sorting and managing large sets of movie documents, such as reviews, scripts, and analyses. Manual organization is time-consuming and prone to human error. The solution is an automated system that can classify documents based on extracted keywords and metadata, with a special focus on organizing movies featuring Robert Downey Jr.

To set up the project, users should clone the repository from GitHub, ensure that Python version 3.10 or higher is installed, and navigate to the project directory. No external libraries are required for this stage of development. The functions can be executed directly in a Python environment such as VS Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook.

The current phase of the project, titled “Project 1: Function Library,” focuses on building a collection of 15 utility functions that support document organization and analysis. These functions demonstrate reusable and maintainable code that will later be incorporated into classes for object-oriented implementation.

Some of the core functions include adding movies, searching by keyword or actor, removing movies, extracting keywords, listing movies, and counting total entries. Medium and complex functions perform more advanced tasks such as calculating similarity between movies using Jaccard analysis, generating movie collection reports, and classifying documents by genre or actor.

Example usage includes initializing a movie collection as a list, adding new movie records, listing existing entries, and performing keyword or actor-based searches.

Each team member contributed to different parts of the project by writing functions, testing them, and ensuring consistency with PEP 8 formatting standards. Future development will build on this foundation by introducing object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, encapsulation, and inheritance.
