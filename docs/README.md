# 📄 Documentation: Information Retrieval and Analysis Tool

## Overview
This folder contains documentation, progress notes, and design explanations for the **Information Retrieval and Analysis Tool** project.

The purpose of this folder is to help our group organize our thoughts, plan our implementation steps, and document what we learn as we build the system.
