# 🗓️ Project Plan — Information Retrieval and Analysis Tool

## 🧠 Overview
This document outlines the timeline, roles, and major tasks for developing the **Information Retrieval and Analysis Tool** — a Python-based system that classifies and analyzes text documents using keyword extraction and content analysis.

## 👥 Team Members & Roles

| Member | Role | Main Responsibilities |
|--------|------|------------------------|
| Khushi Patel | Project Manager | Oversees progress, manages deadlines, ensures all deliverables are consistent |
| Benjamin Podiyan | Backend Developer | Implements core processing and logic in `FunctionLibrary.py` |
| Dritesh Advani | Data & File Manager | Handles document input/output, ensures clean data flow in `document_utils.py` |
| Muhammad Wasay | Tester & Debugger | Creates and maintains `demo_test.py` to verify all functions and modules |

---

## 🧩 Development Phases

| Phase | Tasks | Deliverables | Deadline |
|-------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| **Phase 1: Setup & Planning** | Create repo, folder structure (`src`, `docs`), and project overview | Repo setup with organized files | ✅ Completed |
| **Phase 2: Core Function Design** | Write and test basic functions for text cleaning, word counting, and keyword extraction | Working `FunctionLibrary.py` and `document_utils.py` | Oct 25 |
| **Phase 3: Integration & Testing** | Combine functions into a pipeline and test on multiple sample documents | Functional test results in `demo_test.py` | Oct 29 |
| **Phase 4: Documentation** | Update `/docs` files and final README | Full documentation ready for submission | Oct 31 |

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy
- Each function in `FunctionLibrary.py` will have a corresponding test case in `demo_test.py`.
- We will use small sample `.txt` files in a `data/` folder (to be added later) for consistency.
- Manual testing results will be recorded in `/docs/function_notes.md`.

---

## ✅ Final Deliverables
- `/src/FunctionLibrary.py` → All processing functions  
- `/src/document_utils.py` → Helper and file operations  
- `/src/demo_test.py` → Testing file  
- `/docs/` → Documentation folder (including project plan, notes, and final report)  
- `/README.md` → Main project summary

## 🕐 Weekly Goals
**Week 1:** Setup repo + write base cleaning and counting functions  
**Week 2:** Implement keyword extraction + integrate test cases  
**Week 3:** Refine, debug, and document everything

## 🏁 Expected Outcome
By the end of this project, the team will have created a functional and well-documented information retrieval system that demonstrates object-oriented programming, text processing, and collaborative software development principles.
